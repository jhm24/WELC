<h2>CSS</h2>
  <p>
    Dependent sheets or cascading style sheets (CSS) are mainly used in [1],
     HTML and XHTML, which describe how the markup language is actually
     displayed, and are also available in XML. It is the standard of W3C and has
      a high degree of freedom when defining layout and style.

  If the markup language is responsible for the body of the website,
   CSS can be said to be responsible for decorating such as clothes and
   accessories. In other words, changing the CSS file without leaving the HTML
    structure intact can make it look like a completely different website.
