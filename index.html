  World Wide Web (World Wide Web, WWW, W3) refers to a worldwide information
  space where people can share information through Internet-connected
  computers. It is often simply called the Web. The term is often synonymous
  with the Internet, but strictly speaking, it is a different concept.
  The Web is just one service that works on the Internet, such as e-mail
  But since 1993, the Web has been an absolute position in the Internet structure.

  It also refers to a transmission that uses HTTP protocols, hypertext and HTML
  formats on the Internet to exchange pictures and characters.
