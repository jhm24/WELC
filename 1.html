  </p><p>HTML provides a way to create structural documents
  from links, quotes and other items, as well as represent structural meanings
  for text, such as titles, paragraphs, lists, and so on. It can then be used
  to embed images and objects and to create interactive forms.

   HTMLis createdin the form of an HTML
   element surrounded by a <strong><u>"tag"</u></strong>
  parenthesis in web page content. HTML can include or recall scripts such as
  JavaScript that affect the behavior of HTML processing devices such as web
  browsers and CSS that define appearance and placement of text and other items.
   W3C, co-director of HTML and CSS standards, recommends the use of CSS for clear,
   representational markups.
